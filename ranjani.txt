Hello, I'm Ranjani, a dedicated hard worker hailing from Thuvakudi. I achieved 86% in my 10th grade and continued my academic journey with an impressive 75% in my 12th grade.

My strengths lie in my strong knowledge of programming languages such as C and C++. Beyond academics, I find solace in listening to music, which is one of my hobbies.
